for this project i followed some steps to guess the number

1) Random Number Generation: The game uses Pythonâ€™s random module to generate a random number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 200).
2) User Input: The player is prompted to enter their guess, which is then checked against the randomly generated number.
3) Feedback Loop: After each guess, the game provides feedback:
4) "Too low!" if the guess is lower than the target number.
5) "Too high!" if the guess is higher than the target number.
6) "Congratulations! You've guessed the right number!" if the guess is correct.
7) Loop Until Correct: The game continues to prompt the player for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
8) Play Again Option: After guessing the correct number, the player is given the option to play again or exit the game.
